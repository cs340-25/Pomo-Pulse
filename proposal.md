## Section 1: Introduction
Our project, Pomo-Pulse, is a mobile productivity widget designed to help users manage their time effectively and stay focused directly from their home screen. The widget will feature a Pomodoro Timer, a proven time management technique that alternates between focused work sessions and short breaks. Pomo-Pulse is perfect for students, professionals, and anyone looking to enhance their productivity in a simple and accessible way. Our goal is to create a user-friendly widget that integrates seamlessly into users’ daily routines without draining battery life.
Our motivation for this project is to help users make the most of their time—whether they’re studying for exams, working on a project, or completing tasks at home. In today’s fast-paced world, people often struggle to maintain focus and manage their time effectively. Pomo-Pulse solves this problem by providing instant access to a Pomodoro Timer directly from the home screen, eliminating the need to open a separate app. We want to create a seamless and convenient productivity tool that fits into users’ busy lives, helping them stay focused and productive whenever they need it.
While there are other productivity widgets, such as to-do lists or calendar reminders, Pomo-Pulse is different by offering a fully interactive and customizable Pomodoro Timer. Unlike static widgets that only display information, Pomo-Pulse allows users to start, pause, and reset their timer directly within the widget interface. Additionally, Pomo-Pulse focuses on simplicity and accessibility, making it easy for users to stay on track without distractions. Our target audience includes students, professionals, and anyone who values productivity and time management. Our focus on simplicity, accessibility, and performance ensures that the widget appeals to a broad audience.
Our team consists of members with diverse skill sets and experience in both frontend and backend development, making us well-equipped to tackle the challenges of this project. While our team has a good amount of experience in frontend and backend development, we know that developing widgets for iOS will require learning Swift and SwiftUI. However, given our combined experience with programming languages and frameworks, the learning curve for Swift should not be difficult. We plan to dedicate time during the initial phase of the project to learn Swift and use online resources, tutorials, and documentation to quickly get up to speed.

## Section 2: Customer Value
Our primary customers are students, professionals, and anyone seeking to improve their productivity and time management. Customers want a convenient and effective way to stay focused during work or study sessions without the hassle of opening a full app or navigating complex interfaces. Pomo-Pulse provides instant access to a Pomodoro Timer directly from the home screen, ensuring that productivity tools are always just a tap away. Unlike traditional productivity apps, Pomo-Pulse eliminates boot-up and load times, allowing users to start their timer immediately. Additionally, Pomo-Pulse offers a dynamic and interactive experience that current widgets cannot provide with their static displays.
To measure success, the team will assess satisfaction through key customer-centric measures:
Number of downloads and active users: Tracking user adoption and sustained interest.
User retention rates: Measuring long-term engagement and repeated usage.
Session durations and frequency: Analyzing how often and for how long users utilize the timer.
User feedback: Gathering insights to refine and improve Pomo-Pulse.

## Section 3: Proposed Solution and Technology

Pomo-Pulse will be built using modern technologies to deliver a lightweight, interactive game widget that allows users to play mini-games directly from their home or lock screen. The system will consist of key components like a game engine for managing game logic, a user interface for seamless interaction, a score-tracking system, and a leaderboard for competitive play. We will use tools like SwiftUI and WidgetKit for iOS. While the minimal viable system will include a single mini-game and local score tracking, future enhancements could include additional games, daily challenges, and customization options. Testing will involve unit integration, user, and performance testing to ensure the widget is functional, efficient, and user-friendly. By leveraging existing tools and frameworks, we aim to deliver a high-quality product that meets customer needs while allowing room for future improvements.

## Section 4: Team

One member (Jake Brown) has prior experience building a similar project and working with Swift, which will be crucial for developing the iOS widget. Another member (Vansh Joshi) specializes in frontend development, while the remaining two (Matthew Phan and Larry Wang) have strong backgrounds in backend development. Although Swift and SwiftUI are new to most of us, our collective experience with programming ensures a manageable learning curve. Roles will not be fixed; instead, we will have a collaborative approach where everyone contributes to different parts of the project. This will allow us to share knowledge, tackle challenges together, and ensure all areas, frontend, backend, and Swift development, are covered effectively. 

## Section 5: Project Management

We’re confident we can finish the widget for our iOS app, given our team’s ability to learn quickly and all the online resources out there. We’ll be meeting in person every Monday at 3 pm at Hodges Library, giving ourselves about an hour and a half for our weekly catch-up.

Our app must follow Apple’s guidelines and comply with GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act), and ATT (App Tracking Transparency) if we collect user data, ensuring privacy and transparency. Ethically, we should promote healthy study habits, avoid exploitative gamification, and make the app accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. We’ll also respect user autonomy by avoiding dark patterns, ensuring easy data deletion, and maintaining a trustworthy experience.

If we run into time constraints, we’ll descope non-essential features to focus on delivering a functional product. Our priority is a working Pomodoro timer, accessible via the widget and notification bar. Features like session history, themes, or focus sounds can be added in future updates, ensuring we launch on time without compromising core functionality.
