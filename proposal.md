Section 1: Introduction
Our project, QuickFocus, is a mobile productivity widget designed to help users manage their time effectively and stay focused directly from their home screen. The widget will feature a Pomodoro Timer, a proven time management technique that alternates between focused work sessions and short breaks. QuickFocus is perfect for students, professionals, and anyone looking to enhance their productivity in a simple and accessible way. Our goal is to create a user-friendly widget that integrates seamlessly into users’ daily routines without draining battery life.
Our motivation for this project is to help users make the most of their time—whether they’re studying for exams, working on a project, or completing tasks at home. In today’s fast-paced world, people often struggle to maintain focus and manage their time effectively. QuickFocus solves this problem by providing instant access to a Pomodoro Timer directly from the home screen, eliminating the need to open a separate app. We want to create a seamless and convenient productivity tool that fits into users’ busy lives, helping them stay focused and productive whenever they need it.
While there are other productivity widgets, such as to-do lists or calendar reminders, QuickFocus is different by offering a fully interactive and customizable Pomodoro Timer. Unlike static widgets that only display information, QuickFocus allows users to start, pause, and reset their timer directly within the widget interface. Additionally, QuickFocus focuses on simplicity and accessibility, making it easy for users to stay on track without distractions. Our target audience includes students, professionals, and anyone who values productivity and time management. Our focus on simplicity, accessibility, and performance ensures that the widget appeals to a broad audience.
Our team consists of members with diverse skill sets and experience in both frontend and backend development, making us well-equipped to tackle the challenges of this project. While our team has a good amount of experience in frontend and backend development, we know that developing widgets for iOS will require learning Swift and SwiftUI. However, given our combined experience with programming languages and frameworks, the learning curve for Swift should not be difficult. We plan to dedicate time during the initial phase of the project to learn Swift and use online resources, tutorials, and documentation to quickly get up to speed.
